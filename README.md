RotiKapraMakan

*	Roti Kapra Makan, the essential & basic necessities of a life are both uncommon & non-basic for people in Pakistan, states World Bank in her 2013 report.  The report figures 60 % of countries population to be living below poverty line of $2/day. Furthermore over 30 % of nations’ children are suffering from malnutrition and underweight. 
*	No govt. & no organization can stand tall overnight to giant of this magnitude, but together we people however, can.
*	The app has url "Roti-kapra-makan.azurewebsites.net"
*	Ironically, we all live in a community where sights of hunger & poverty are both common & abundant. We have people in need of food, drinking water, work, shelter & medicine around us. Whenever we find one of them, we toss them a coin or two & think good being done. That doesn’t. It never did.
*	Roti Kapra Makan isn’t a charity based organization; where a donor never gets to know whether his donation brought any relief to someone’s sufferings. It’s not remotely close to that. It’s a real life, real time implementation of a community healing itself. 
*	Donor & receiver are two key stakeholders of any donation process and normally there’s a big gap between the two, i.e., potential donors never get to know whom to give & whom not to. Roti Kapra Makan connects the two.
*	Anyone with a civic sense & with intentions of healing the society only needs to specify (Locate) the needy around him & his need via simple SMS to 6600. Our system then, locates the potential donors in that particular area & will ask them to help out the needy with his needs. As soon as the need is met, and the system receives the need met SMS by the informer or the helper, it updates the need status & informs the world.
*	Roti Kapra Makan is an integrated system of a Website (www.roti-kapra-makan.azureservices.net), a smartphone app (in progress) & a SMS service (functional) working in coherence to ensure our applications wide reach to general public, both to specify donors & to meet their needs.
*	Our Facebook page (www.facebook.com/RotiKapraMakan) & twitter (#rkm) are to ensure the widespread.
